# plastic-waste-detection

Project for Capstone (CSRS4)

### Idea
One of the sustainable development goals of the united nation is responsible consumption and production, the world has been producing plastic in a drastic way that it has been harming our environment. In response to the above-mentioned concerns, we came up with an idea which is detecting a plastic waste using a [YOLO v4 algorithm](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).

### The objectives of this project are:
- To detect plastic objects in a dataset
- To make segregation much easier

### Possible Application
The system can be used by LGUs for proper waste management.

### Functions and features
